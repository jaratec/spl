Scala Powered Lisp

The lisp can be run in sbt (with run command). Or can be run as a an application. Class Repl has a main method. Either way you will have a repl where you can type lisp expression. There are some commands built in (load - to load some file containing definitions and exit - to exit the repl):
:load file_name
:exit
