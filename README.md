spl

Scala Powered Lisp

The lisp can be run in sbt (with run command). Or can be run as a an application. Class Repl has a main method. Either way you will have a repl where you can type lisp expression. There are some commands built in (load - to load some file containing definitions and exit - to exit the repl):
* :load file_name
* :exit

More information on how the lisp implementation was built: a [non-blog post](http://jaratec.github.io/2013/10/26/spl.html) and a [presentation](http://prezi.com/user/jaratec/).
